What? No, this isn't actually a script file.
For your inconvienence, all of the code has been neatly* bundled in the nice little index.html over there.
No, not here in "script.js"...
It's over in "index.html".

BTW BloxBox 0.5 or something will probably be a formatting update for index.html, so it becomes WAYYY more easy to use.
