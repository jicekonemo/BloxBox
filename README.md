BloxBox 0.1.1<br>
BloxBox is an experimental modification of BeepBox 4.2. BeepBox was created by John Nevsky.<br>
BloxBox is not meant to replace any other mods of BeepBox, but rather to experiment with coding and editing stuff.<br>
BloxBox was initially created by downloading the BeepBox Offline HTML file, and then raw editing it. *NOTE: not recommended. It's really cramped and just weird to sift through. (Espeially since all of the main code for BeepBox is formatted into just 3 lines...)<br>
BloxBox is free to use, can be freely distrubuted (under the accomodation that the LICENSE provided gets reproduced without edit), and does not claim copyright over songs made with it, nor does it claim resposibility for copyrighted material created with it. No songs are ever received or relayed via BloxBox's (GitHub) servers, except for direct communication between BloxBox and your device.<br><br><br>
BloxBox will be on the moon soon...
